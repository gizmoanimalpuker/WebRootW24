                <h3>Summary of resource</h3>
            A resource for all kinds of programmers with tutorials and other kinds of resources. There are all kinds of materials for users to brush up on material and review.
            <h3>Body of review </h3> 
            A site that has a lot of resources and guides on different languages for programmers. 
It even has comprehensive guides for different subjects. 
This site is made for any developers but goes in depth on a lot of languages used for web development, including web API’s.
 Personally I will be using this site’s references to reference different commands as it’s been over 6 months since I’ve programmed with any web based languages and I have to brush up on syntax and commands constantly.<br />
 I will continue to use it this way as I don’t remember all the commands.

            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow.com</a>
            <h3>Summary of resource</h3> 
            A forum type website that functinos off of users posting and other users leaving comments to help with whatever issue is at hand.
            <h3>Body of review </h3> 
            Stackoverflow is a forum based website akin to reddit, but for programmers. 
 It’s a place that developers can go to ask and answer questions. 
It’s useful once again for any kind of developer, but can come particularly in handy when there’s a complex issue or system that someone needs to have looked at by a real person, rather than relying on the funky way AI work to help out.<br /> 
I will use this to get real developer’s opinions on problems, and to also be able to google my problem, and pretty reliably be able to find someone else who’s had a similar problem years prior; I get instant answers right there and then. <br />

            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.com</a>
            <h3>Summary of resource</h3> 
            A site with lots of materials on various languages, including web languages. Users can use the materials to refer back to on specific functions and methods.
            <h3>Body of review </h3> 
            W3schools is a site where anyone can go to find references and tutorials. 
Any kid of dev can get information off of w3schools as it has a variety of topics and languages covered, including web languages.
I will mostly use w3schools as a reference as again, I don’t always remember commands and it’s just helpful to have it open in the background, incase I need to reference a command or syntax or something like that.

            <a href="https://overapi.com/">overapi.com</a>
            <h3>Summary of resource</h3> 
            Another site with a lot of material across a broad range of topics and languages. Users can use this material to refresh their memory and learn new material within a lot of different languages, including SQL.
            <h3>Body of review </h3>  
            Overapi is again very similar to w3schools, where it has a lot of references.
However it’s set up a bit differently.
 You can search for specific commands and functions within a certain language and then it will take you to a page with lots of information and use cases for that command.
 It covers a variety of languages even SQL which I find extremely useful, as I worked with SQL in one class briefly, so I really haven’t had the time to memorize all the commands, even if they’re relatively simple. I will definitely be using it as a reference in my future career.

            <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">getbootstrap.com</a>
            <h3>Summary of resource</h3>  
            This is a source that specializes specifically in web languaes and bootstraps specifically. getbootstrap also offers documents of various kinds, including blogs to teach users bootstrap.
            <h3>Body of review </h3> 
            Bootstrap is a framework used specifically in HTML, CSS, and Javascript projects; Web projects.
 It is used to help style web pages in specific ways. 
I know that we use bootstrap in our class so I wanted to get something that will help with that. Getbootstrap.com has examples as well as blogs to help get a hang of what exactly bootstrap can do.
 Another feature that is very useful is the doc feature where it basically has a lot of features laid out in a list and you can click on each one and find how to create and use it with bootstrap.
